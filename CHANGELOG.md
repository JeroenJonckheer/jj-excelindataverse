## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-01

First release of JJ - Excel in Dataverse.

### Added
- Spreadsheet-style dataset PCF control (`jj_Grids.Spreadsheet`) for Model-Driven Apps.
- Inline cell editing for text, number, date, choice and lookup columns.
- Lookup autocomplete with type-ahead search and selection of an existing record.
- Lookup resolution on paste: pasted text is matched to a record by primary name
  (trimmed, case-insensitive) or by GUID; no match or several matches mark the
  cell invalid; values are resolved once and cached for large pastes.
- Keyboard navigation with Tab, Enter and the arrow keys.
- Paste from Excel across multiple cells and rows, including Excel quoting; a
  paste that runs past the end of the grid adds new rows instead of dropping data.
- Add new rows by scrolling past the bottom or pressing the down arrow on the
  last row, and create them in Dataverse on save.
- Undo and redo (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y) for edits, deletes and pastes.
- Only the view's layout columns are shown (non-layout columns are hidden).
- Metadata-driven validation: required level, maximum length, numeric minimum,
  maximum and precision, email, phone and URL formats, choice options and lookup
  references. No rules are invented beyond what the column metadata provides.
- Save to Dataverse per record, with per-cell validation gating and server-side
  rejection handling that keeps the remaining changes.
- Automatic column distribution across the full width.
- White (#ffffff) editing background and the control version in the footer.
- Layered test suite: Jest unit tests, React Testing Library component tests and
  Playwright end-to-end tests against an offline harness.
- Buildable unmanaged and managed solutions (`solution/`).
